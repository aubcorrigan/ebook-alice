      <p>‘Curiouser and curiouser!’ cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); ‘now I’m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!’ (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off).</p>

      <p>She was shrinking rapidly, and before she knew it she was down to only ten inches high. Her first thought was that she might as well go into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery.</p>

      <p>Poor Alice wept bitterly. She cried so much that her tears made a large pool all around her, about four inches deep and reaching halfway down the hall. Soon she heard a splash in the pool, and in she went again, swimming about, trying to find her way.</p>
