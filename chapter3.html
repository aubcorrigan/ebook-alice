      <p>They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank — the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.</p>

      <p>The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. She had never before seen such a curious assemblage of creatures.</p>

      <p>At last the Dodo said, ‘The best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.’ The others all cried ‘What’s a Caucus-race?’ and the Dodo replied ‘The best way to explain it is to do it.’</p>

      <p>And they all set to work running round and round in a sort of circle, without any clear direction, and after half an hour or so, the race came to an end. Everyone had won, and all were entitled to prizes.</p>
